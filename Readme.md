# Reinforcement Learning Using PyTorch for playing Snake 

This repo contains code where we teach an AI to play Snake! using Deep Q Learning Method. The Code is implemented in PyTorch and the game is setup using PyGame.

**Reinforcement Learning** is an area of Machine Learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. In other words, Reinforcement Learning is teaching a software agent how to behave in an environment by telling it how good its doing.

**Deep Q Learning** is an approach that extends Reinforcement Learning by using a DNN to predict the next actions



## Packages Required
1. pygame
2. pytorch (without CUDA)
3. matplotlib
